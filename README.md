## 👥 User Roles & Ownership

### Three Core Roles

<table>
<tr>
<td align="center">
<h4>🧑‍⚕️ Patient</h4>
<p>Primary user and data owner</p>
</td>
<td align="center">
<h4>👨‍👩‍👧 Family/Caregiver</h4>
<p>Support role using the same app</p>
</td>
<td align="center">
<h4>👨‍⚕️ Doctor</h4>
<p>Medical professional providing prescriptions</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

### 🔒 Ownership Principle

> **The patient is ALWAYS the owner of their medical data.**
> 
> All viewing or actions by Family or Doctor must be explicitly allowed by patient permission settings.

**💡 User Story:**
```
As a patient, I own my prescription and dose records, 
so I can control who can access my data.
```

---

## 🔗 Connection System

### 🤝 Doctor Connection (Two-Way Accept)

Connection can be initiated by **either side**, but **MUST** be accepted by the other.

#### 📋 Connection Flow

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Doctor/Patient] -->|Sends Request| B[Other Party]
    B -->|Accepts| C[Patient Sets Permissions]
    C --> D[Connected ✓]
```

<details>
<summary><b>Case A: Doctor Initiates</b></summary>

1. 👨‍⚕️ Doctor sends connection request to patient
2. 🧑‍⚕️ Patient must accept
3. 🔐 After acceptance, patient chooses permission level for doctor

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Case B: Patient Initiates</b></summary>

1. 🧑‍⚕️ Patient sends connection request to doctor
2. 👨‍⚕️ Doctor must accept
3. 🔐 After acceptance, patient chooses permission level for doctor

</details>

> ⚠️ **Important:** Even if the doctor accepts, the patient remains the owner and controls permission level.

---

#### 🔐 Permission Levels

| Permission | Icon | Description |
|-----------|:----:|-------------|
| **NOT_ALLOWED** | 🚫 | Doctor has no access |
| **REQUEST** | 🙋 | Doctor must request access each time (policy-based) |
| **SELECTED** | 📌 | Doctor has access only to selected items (specific prescriptions or time ranges) |
| **ALLOWED** | ✅ | Doctor has access to view history and data reports (default) |

#### ⚙️ Default Permission Behavior

When connection is confirmed:
- System shows a permission popup
- If user clicks **"OK"** without changes → Default = `ALLOWED` (view history/data report)

---

#### 📝 User Stories

```
✓ As a doctor, I can request to connect to a patient, 
  so I can monitor adherence once the patient accepts.

✓ As a patient, I can connect to a doctor, 
  so my doctor can help manage my medication plan.

✓ As a patient, I can set doctor permission to NOT_ALLOWED/REQUEST/SELECTED/ALLOWED, 
  so I stay in control of my privacy.
```

#### ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- [x] A doctor cannot view patient data without an accepted connection
- [x] After connection, doctor access is controlled by the patient permission enum
- [x] Default permission applies only when user clicks OK without selecting custom permissions

---

### 👨‍👩‍👧 Family Connection

Family members use the **same app**. After connection, they gain special advantages.

#### 🎁 Connection Advantages

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🔔 **Missed-Dose Alerts** | Family receives alerts based on patient reminder/escalation rules |
| 👀 **Mutual View** | Both sides can view each other's history records (controlled by permissions) |
| 🔄 **Revocable Access** | Patient can revoke family access anytime |

> 📋 **Important:** All actions from family are audit logged.

---

#### 📝 User Stories

```
✓ As a patient, I connect my family 
  so they can remind me when I miss medication.

✓ As a family member, I receive alerts 
  so I can support the patient to take medicine on time.

✓ As a patient, I can revoke family access anytime 
  so I can protect my privacy.
```

#### ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- [x] If patient misses medication, family gets notified when online or later when sync occurs
- [x] Connection allows viewing history records depending on permission settings
- [x] Revoking permission removes access immediately

---

## 💊 Prescription Management

### 🔄 Prescription Lifecycle

```
Draft → Active → Paused → Inactive/Stopped
```

| Status | Icon | Description |
|--------|:----:|-------------|
| **Draft** | 📝 | Saved but not active, no schedule/reminders |
| **Active** | ✅ | Schedule generated, reminders enabled |
| **Paused** | ⏸️ | Temporary stop, history remains |
| **Inactive/Stopped** | 🛑 | Ended, history remains |

---

### 📚 Versioning System

#### Core Rules

- ❌ **No destructive edits**
- 🆕 Doctor modifications create a **new version**
- 📜 Old versions kept in **history**
- 📋 All changes recorded in **audit log**

---

### ⚡ Urgent Change Rule

Doctors can **auto-apply** urgent changes for patient safety:

```
Doctor marks urgent → System applies immediately → Patient notified → Logged in history
```

> 📌 **Must still appear in patient history and audit logs**

#### 📝 User Stories

```
✓ As a doctor, I can urgently change a prescription and auto-apply it, 
  so the patient immediately follows the new schedule.

✓ As a patient, I can see urgent changes in history, 
  so I know what changed and why.
```

#### ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Auto-applied changes create a new version
- [x] History shows: who changed, what changed, when, and reason
- [x] Patient is notified even when auto-applied

---

## 📊 Dose Tracking

### 📌 DoseEvent Status

| Status | Icon | Time Window |
|--------|:----:|-------------|
| **Due** | ⏰ | Scheduled but not yet taken |
| **Taken (On time)** | ✅ | Within allowed window |
| **Taken (Late)** | ⚠️ | After window but before cutoff |
| **Missed** | ❌ | Past cutoff without being taken |
| **Skipped** | ⏭️ | Optional: Manually skipped with reason |

### ⏱️ Time-Window Logic

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                         │
│  Within Window → ✅ Taken (On time)                     │
│  After Window  → ⚠️ Taken (Late)                        │
│  Past Cutoff   → ❌ Missed                              │
│                                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**💡 User Story:**
```
As a patient, I can mark taken, 
so my adherence record is accurate.
```

---

## ⏰ Reminder System

### 🎯 Core Principle

> **Reminders MUST work in both online and offline states.**

---

### 🔧 A) Reminder Creation

When prescription becomes `Active`:

1. 📅 Generate DoseEvents (schedule)
2. 💾 Store schedule in:
   - ☁️ Backend database
   - 📱 Local storage on device

> This ensures offline reminders can still fire without internet.

**💡 User Story:**
```
As a patient, I still receive reminders even when offline, 
so I don't miss medication.
```

---

### 📱 B) Offline Reminder Delivery

#### How It Works

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  OFFLINE MODE                                           │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  1. 📱 Phone uses local schedule                        │
│  2. 🔔 Sends notification to patient                    │
│  3. ✅ Patient taps "Taken"                             │
│  4. 💾 Store in local queue (pending sync)              │
│                                                         │
│  WHEN ONLINE                                            │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  5. 🔄 Sync queued actions to backend                   │
│  6. ✅ Backend updates DoseEvent & audit log            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**💡 User Story:**
```
As a patient, I can mark taken offline and it will sync later, 
so my records stay correct.
```

---

### 👨‍👩‍👧 C) Offline Missed-Dose Handling & Family Notification

#### The Problem

Offline device can detect missed dose locally, but **cannot notify family immediately**.

#### The Solution

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  OFFLINE MISSED DOSE                                    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  1. ❌ Missed dose detected locally                     │
│  2. 💾 Store missed state + evidence                    │
│                                                         │
│  WHEN ONLINE                                            │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  3. 🔄 System syncs                                     │
│  4. 🔔 Sends missed alert to family (late but guaranteed)│
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

> ⚠️ **Important:** Late family alert must clearly indicate it was sent after reconnect/sync.

#### 📝 User Stories

```
✓ As a family member, I still get notified about missed doses 
  even if the patient was offline, so I can follow up.

✓ As a patient, I understand late alerts happen after reconnect, 
  so I don't get confused.
```

#### ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Offline patient reminders still fire on time (local notifications)
- [x] Offline taken actions sync when online and update backend
- [x] Offline missed alerts are delivered to family after online sync (late but guaranteed)

---

## 🩺 PRN Medications (As Needed)

**PRN** = "Pro Re Nata" (as needed)

### ⚙️ Default Behavior

- 🌏 System uses **Cambodia time** as the default timezone
- ⏰ User should input reminder time(s)
- 🤖 If user does not input reminder times:
  - System automatically uses **default reminder times** (Cambodia timezone presets)
  - Example presets: 🌅 morning / ☀️ noon / 🌆 evening / 🌙 night
  - Exact times configurable in UI settings

---

### 📝 User Stories

```
✓ As a patient, I can set PRN reminder times, 
  so reminders match my real usage.

✓ As a patient, if I skip setting times, 
  the app uses default Cambodia-time presets so I still get reminders.
```

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- [x] PRN supports manual "Taken" without strict schedule if configured that way
- [x] If no PRN times entered, app auto-assigns default times using Cambodia timezone

---

## 📝 Audit Logging

### 🔍 What Gets Logged

Every action is tracked for complete transparency:

| Category | Events Logged |
|----------|---------------|
| 🔗 **Connections** | Connection requests and acceptances |
| 🔐 **Permissions** | Permission changes (enum changes) |
| 👀 **Access** | Who viewed what (based on policy) |
| 💊 **Prescriptions** | Creation and version changes |
| ⚡ **Urgent Changes** | Auto-apply changes |
| 🔔 **Reminders** | Reminders sent (including offline-late notifications) |
| ✅ **Dose Events** | Taken/missed events and sync time |

**💡 User Story:**
```
As a patient, I can audit who accessed or changed my data, 
so I trust the system.
```

#### 📝 User Stories

```
✓ As a patient, I still get reminders offline 
  so I can take medicine on time.

✓ As a family member, I get missed-dose alerts 
  even if the patient was offline, so I can still help.

- 📱 Reminders must function **offline** and sync actions later
- 💳 Subscription plans: **Freemium**, **Premium**, **Family Premium**
